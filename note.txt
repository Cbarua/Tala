I want cross-browser compatiblity. 
The default styles are inconsistent across different browsers.
There are 2 options available. Normalize.css and CSS reset.
It's better to use both.

It's been 3 days since I studied. I studied about the <main> tag on the 30th of July.
I've been busy with binge-watching The big bang theory. :(

#3
I thought about understanding the <main> tag more and html5 semantic tags in general.
After reading, I am not sure if this projects needs this.
If so, how should I use it.

I read Elad Shechter's Medium blog posts. 
I found some ideas about naming and organizing things in CSS.
The naming convention he suggests I've seen it use on Bootstrap.css

I've had some confusion using BEM in my Veggie project.
I took the whole block__element--modifier thing to heart.
I realized it after reading Elad Shechter's Medium blog.
"feature-item > feature-item__title" wasn't necessary.
"feature__title" looks nice. 
I should've used "container--header" to modify container not "header__container".

background-size: cover;
"background-attachment: fixed;" to make sure the entire element is always covered.

"background" shorthand property the order of the property values are
color, image, repeat, attachment, and position.

EM is relative to the parent element's font size.
REM is relative to the root (HTML) font size.
CH is the width of "o" in the specified font family.
Paragraphs should not exceeds 75 characters for readability. It's a good use for "ch" unit.
EM is better to be used for paddings in buttons because easier to adjust with font size.
Using REM helps us scale elements according user's browser settings preference.
62.5% === 10px in html font-size because default font-size is 16px.
It makes it easy to work with REM units ex: 21px === 2.1 rem.

Gray overlay to header background image.
I've used the linear-gradient method before. 
I'm not a fan of it because to adjust the overlay I have to change 2 places. 
I could use a variable for the color so I only need to change the variable. 
"background-blend-mode" isn't supported in IE, and older browsers. That's why I didn't use it.
box-shadow: 0 0 0 50vw hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.64);

".header { display: block;height: 100vh; }".
".header > .container { display: grid; height: 100%; }".
".container" inheriting the height of 100vh and also ".navbar"'s height causing 
the ".header" to overflow.
Set "display: grid;" to ".header".
I also wanted the ".container" to have the rest of the space minus ".navbar"
so I can center the ".banner". Set "grid-template-rows: max-content;" to ".header".

[].forEach.call($$("*"),function(a){a.style.outline="1px solid #"+(~~(Math.random()*(1<<24))).toString(16)})
There are 2 things about this function. $$() and .call().
$$() function is clear in the code above. 
It only works in browser console window. It doesn't work in a external .js file.

"[].forEach.call()" is a shorthand for "Array.prototype.forEach.call(...)".
".call()" is a function prototype. 
The first argument replaces "this" of the calling function. 
In this case, it's ".forEach()". 
The rest of the arguments will be passed to the calling function. 
Example:
[1, 2, 3].forEach.call(["a", "b", "c"], function (item, i, arr) {
    console.log(i + ": " + item);
});
// 0: "a"
// 1: "b"
// 2: "c"

".header" was overflowing. 
".btn" had huge padding. The cause is ".nav-toggle" also had ".btn" class. 
"flex-wrap: wrap;" with "display: flex;" prevents overflowing.

#13
I decided to use only CSS grid in this project over flexbox 
even though things can be done simply using flexbox.
I changed ".wrapper" to a grid. I had to add "grid-auto-flow: column;".
I found a cool resource to refresh my knowledge of CSS grid.
https://learncssgrid.com/

#14
I previously added paddings to ".btn" to make it big.
The problem is more text makes it bigger in size. I want it to stay the same.
So, defined width & height instead of padding and used EM to define them.
EM is good use for this because it adjust the element according to font-size.

I wanted to learn jQuery again. So I took freecodecamp jQuery lessons.
I used jQuery in this project. It makes it so simple.
jQuery cdn -> https://code.jquery.com

#16
I used ".slideToggle()" to show and hide the ".nav-menu". jQuery makes it so simple.
If ".slideDown()" is called on an unordered list (<ul>) and 
its <li> elements have position (relative, absolute, or fixed), 
the effect may not work properly in IE6 through at least IE9 unless 
the <ul> has "layout." To remedy the problem, 
add the "position: relative; zoom: 1;" CSS declarations to the ul.
https://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
"zoom" is IE only property.

Translates to support CSS3 transforms on IE.

I seperated element class names for CSS and JS. It's considered a good practice.
Elad's "Naming things in CSS" Medium blog post.

#18
".nav-menu" appearing behind ".banner". The ".nav-menu" must be on top of every element.
".banner" was appearing that way because it came after ".nav-menu".
Setting "z-index" on ".nav-menu" didn't work. 
".navbar" "position: sticky" without explicity defined "z-index" caused it.
".navbar" is ".nav-menu" grand-parent.
https://coder-coder.com/z-index-isnt-working/

#19
".nav-menu" is dependent on jQuery. 
I need it to show if Javascript is disabled in browser.
I used the Veggie project as an inspiration. I used CSS to toggle ".nav-menu".

The general sibling selector "~" selector is important in this method.
It selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_combinators.asp

For it to work, I needed to put ".nav-menu" next to ".nav-toggle".
".nav-toggle" was inside ".wrapper". 
So I removed ".wrapper" and added its properties to ".container--navbar".

I found :target selector. 
I added "id=menu" to ".nav-menu" and changed 
".nav-toggle" <button> to <a> to link it with ".nav-menu"
so I can "target" ".nav-menu" to show when ".nav-toggle" is clicked.
".nav-menu:target { transform: translateY(0); }"
The problem is, it adds the "menu" id to the base url 
so browser "goback" button needs to used to hide ".nav-menu".
https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_target.asp

Changing ".nav-toggle" <button> to <a> element isn't a good idea.
I need ".nav-menu" to animate and show when ".nav-toggle" is clicked.
".nav-menu" also needs to stay in place until 
the user clicked on one of the links on it or 
clicked elsewhere on the page to hide ".nav-menu".
".nav-toggle:focus ~ .nav-menu" needs to be used but it doesn't work with <a>.
So I reverted the change.
".nav-toggle:focus-within ~ .nav-menu" works too.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within

I checked how jQuery ".slideToggle()" works. It animates the height.
Set ".nav-menu" height to "0". 
Set ".nav-toggle:focus ~ .nav-menu" height to ".nav-menu" original height ("336.35px").
I don't like this method because the height needs to be defined explicity.
Setting height to "100%" isn't enough because it's the parent's height.
The animation doesn't work when height is to "auto" or "fit-content".

To animate the both open and close animations, "transition" needs to be in ".nav-menu".

I tried to animate using "translateY()".
Set ".nav-menu" transform to "translateY(-100%)". 
Set ".nav-toggle:focus ~ .nav-menu" transform to "translateY(0)".
It doesn't work because the element doesn't have
an element on top of it to hide.
Adding a div on top of it doesn't fix because 
".header" background-image must be shown.
I tried to position it below ".header" using z-index but no avail.
Got the "translateY()" idea from below.

Bootstrap containers.

This makes the text always stay the same in different screen sizes.

#23
The original project buttons don't have their texts covered up
by their pseudo-elements problem.
It uses "translate3d()".
// Only the changes
.btn::before, .btn::after {
  bottom: 100%;
  left: 0;
  z-index: -1;
  transition: transform 0.3s;
}
.btn:hover::before, .btn:hover::after {
  transform: translate3d(0, 100%, 0);
}
